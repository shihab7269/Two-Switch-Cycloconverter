# Two-Switch-Multiconverter
Single-phase to single-phase multiconverter laboratory prototype hardware design and drive.

It presents a novel single-phase to single-phase multiconverter topology that can be applied in multiple areas including:

        1. Frequency up converter
        2. Frequency down converter
        3. AC volatge regulator
        4. DC volatge regulator

### Circuit Diagram
The following figure shows the single-phase to single-phase multiconverter circuit topology. It uses only two soft power semiconductor switches (e.g. MOSFET or IGBT), four power diodes and a center-tapped transformer which makes it more compact in size, decrease the gate driving complexity, reduce the total equipment costs and enhance the energy conversion efficiency with minimized losses.

### Operating Principle
There are four common working modes of this converter during all of the active conversion modes which are shown as following figure. Thus, the explanation of these four working modes help to understand the operating principle of the converter as any of the aforesaid converter.

### Multi-converter Applications
Nevertheless, the working principle of the proposed multiconverter is described according to the individual active energy conversion mode in the following subsections.

#### 1. Step-Down Frequency Converter
Generally, the step-down cycloconverter provides an output voltage of frequency less than the frequency of the input voltage. The presented converter can be operated to convert the input frequency to its half (25 Hz), one-third (17 Hz), one-fourth (12.5 Hz) and so on output frequency as a step-down cycloconverter. Here, only two frequency conversion i.e. half (25 Hz) and one-third (17 Hz) frequency conversions are shown.
