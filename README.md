# Two-Switch-Multiconverter
Single-phase to single-phase multiconverter laboratory prototype hardware design and drive.

It presents a novel single-phase to single-phase multiconverter topology that can be applied in multiple areas including:

        1. Frequency up converter
        2. Frequency down converter
        3. AC volatge regulator
        4. DC volatge regulator

### Circuit Diagram
The following figure shows the single-phase to single-phase multiconverter circuit topology. It uses only two soft power semiconductor switches (e.g. MOSFET or IGBT), four power diodes and a center-tapped transformer which makes it more compact in size, decrease the gate driving complexity, reduce the total equipment costs and enhance the energy conversion efficiency with minimized losses.
